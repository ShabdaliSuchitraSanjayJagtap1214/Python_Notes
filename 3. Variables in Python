Variables in Python :-

Defination :-
    (i) A variable is a name given to any storage area or memory location in a Python program.
    (ii) Data or Values can be stored in temporary storage space called variable.
    (iii) In simple words we can say that a variable is a container that contains some infomation and whenever we need that information we use the name of that container to access it.
    (iv) Therefore, In order to declare variable there is no need to specify any Datatypes so that's why we can say Python is Dynamically Typed Programming Language.
    (v) Variable comes with 3 things that is Name of the variable, Value of the variable, Address of the variable.
Example :-
    a = 10
To order a variable we have to follow the rules of identifier:- 
  Rules to define identifiers :-
    (i) Alphabet (either lower case[a-z] or upper case[A-Z])
    (ii) Digits (0 to 9)
    (iii) Underscore Symbol (_)
    (iv) Identifier should not starts with digit
          a) 123total  X
          b) total123  √
    (v) By mistake if we are using any other symbol like $ then we will get syntax error
          a) cash = 10  √
          b) ca$h =20   X
    (vi) Identifiers are case sensitive. Of course Python language is case sensitive language.
          a) total=10 ->  print(total) -> Output 10
          b) TOTAL=999 -> print(TOTAL) -> Output 999
    (vii) We cannot use Keywords or Reserved words as identifiers
          a) def = 10  X
          b) if = 20  X
    (viii) There is no length limit for Python identifiers. But not recommended to use too lengthy identifiers
    (ix) Blankspace are not allowed 
          total cost = 10  X
          totalcost = 20   √
  Note :-
    1. If identifier starts with _ symbol then it indicates that it is private
    2. If identifier starts with __(two under score symbols) indicating that strongly private identifier
    3.If the identifier starts and ends with two underscore symbols then the identifier is language defined special name,which is also known as magic methods
    Eg: __add__
