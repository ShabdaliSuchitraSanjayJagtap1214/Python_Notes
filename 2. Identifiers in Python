Defination :-
    (i) A name in Python program is called identifier.
    (ii) It can be class name or function name or module name or variable name.
Example :-
    a = 10
Rules to define identifiers :-
    (i) Alphabet (either lower case[a-z] or upper case[A-Z])
    (ii) Digits (0 to 9)
    (iii) Underscore Symbol (_)
    (iv) Identifier should not starts with digit
          a) 123total  X
          b) total123  √
    (v) By mistake if we are using any other symbol like $ then we will get syntax error
          a) cash = 10  √
          b) ca$h =20   X
    (vi) Identifiers are case sensitive. Of course Python language is case sensitive language.
          a) total=10 ->  print(total) -> Output 10
          b) TOTAL=999 -> print(TOTAL) -> Output 999
    (vii) We cannot use Keywords or Reserved words as identifiers
          a) def = 10  X
          b) if = 20  X
    (viii) There is no length limit for Python identifiers. But not recommended to use too lengthy identifiers
    (ix) Blankspace are not allowed 
          total cost = 10  X
          totalcost = 20   √

Question :- Which of the following are valid Python identifiers?
            1) 123total X
            2) total123 √
            3) java2share √
            4) ca$h X
            5) _abc_abc_ √
            6) def X
            7) if X
Note :-
    1. If identifier starts with _ symbol then it indicates that it is private
    2. If identifier starts with __(two under score symbols) indicating that strongly private identifier
    3.If the identifier starts and ends with two underscore symbols then the identifier is language defined special name,which is also known as magic methods
    Eg: __add__
