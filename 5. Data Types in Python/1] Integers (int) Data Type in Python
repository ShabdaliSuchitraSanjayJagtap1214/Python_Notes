Integers (int) Data Type in Python :-

Defination :-
    (i) We can use int data type to represent whole numbers (integral values).
    (ii) Integer Data is basically your integer values.
    (iii) Int - 1,2,3,------âˆž
Eg :-
    a = 10
    type(a) 
    Output -> int
Note:
    In Python2 we have long data type to represent very large integral values.But in Python3 there is no long type explicitly 
    and we can represent long values also by using int type only.
We can represent int values in the following ways:-
    1. Decimal form
    2. Binary form
    3. Octal form
    4. Hexa decimal form
